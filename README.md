CAT is about tracking applications.

The goal is to be able to know where which application is; it's sources, it's build environment, it's artifacts and - if it has one - it's runtime environment.

Basicly, a lightweight CMDB aimed at helping developers survive today's highly dynamic environments with ephemeral build servers, changing runtimes and so on.

It should be a scalable highly available service, that keeps track of some basic information.
More information should be a relation to external systems only, so this stays lightweight, small and fast!
